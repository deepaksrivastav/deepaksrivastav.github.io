iCPU is an intelligent CPU Overclocker for Motorola Magx phones. The idea is to run the CPU at max speeds when the Backlight is ON (i.e when the phone is in use) and down clock it to the minimum frequency when the Backlight is OFF (i.e. when the phone is not in use). Thereby saving battery as well as maximizing speed when the phone is in use.

It is possible to set the maximum and minimum frequency as per user requirement and is a part of the iCPU settings. It is also possible to enable Autorun which runs the application when the phone starts up.
